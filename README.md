# Heatwatt Plugin Example
This example demonstrates how to create a simple plugin which updates its data automatically whenever the user switches projects/variants, changes inputs provided by the plugin or edits the buildings on the map.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository and [install luucy cli](https://github.com/luucyadmin/luucy-cli).

Open a terminal and run the following command:
